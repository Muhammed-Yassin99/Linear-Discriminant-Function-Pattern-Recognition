# Linear Discriminant Function(LDA) implementation
We usedthe Iris Dataset to implement a classifier (Linear Discriminant Function) to linearly classify each test sample.
Dividing the dataset into (15% Testing) & (85% Training)
Regarding the Dataset:
1) It includes three iris species (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor) with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower.
2) One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.
3) The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals)
